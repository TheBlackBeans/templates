# BlackBeans' templates
## Rust
Default Rust project flake, working with `naersk` and `direnv`.
## Rust Prologin
Rust application template especially made for Prologin problems. In particular, it does not care for having a `src` directory, and already has input reading functions.
## C
Default C project flake, with a `Makefile` and `direnv`.
